# Data Science in Manufacturing

The University of Edinburgh is hosting, for the second year, a university-certified, 10-credit, online course in data visualisation with flexible schedule. The course runs in 2021 from Tues, May 4th – Sat, July 10th (10 weeks) and is dedicated to professionals in—among others—finance, the sports industry, the creative industry, journalism, education and the public sector. Further runs of the course later this year are in preparation.

Meet the organizers and join our open info session on MS Teams (installed MS Teams application required). The session gives an overview over the course and we will answer questions. Sessions times are

    Thu, April 22, 6-7pm, BST
    Mon, April 26, 6-7pm, BST

### This online course teaches how to

    visually explore data
    criticise data visualisations,
    design visualisations, and
    implement data visualisations.

### It covers the fundamentals of

    human perception and data visualisation,
    exploratory data analysis,
    the importance of interaction in exploration,
    techniques for data visualisation (networks, temporal data, geographic data, etc..),
    storytelling and communication,
    tools for data visualisation, and
    evaluation.

With an aim to build skills that allow participants to directly apply their learning, the course features online videos and reading material, mini tutorials, drop-in sessions, complementary online teaching material, and seminars by guest speakers. More about the course organisation and its schedule.

We encourage BYOD—bring and work on your own data project (we can sign non-disclosure agreements). Alternatively, class examples will include open-access data on a variety of topical issues such as climate change, COVID-19 and gender participation (e.g., the No Ceilings project (github repository), and Scotland’s Open Data Catalogues.
Learning Outcomes

    **Analyse:** Describe a challenge for a visualisation project and the reasons why visualisation is required.
    **Structure:** Break down the project considering its context (target audience, usage scenario), potential tasks that the visualisation should facilitate, and the characteristics of the data set.
    **Design+Implement:** Create a visualisation through one of various media (website, interactive, infographic, etc.) and through a self-selected set of tools (e.g., Tableau, D3.js), to match the earlier identified challenge.
    **Evaluation:** Critically reflect on a visualisation design and suggest constructive solutions.
    **Apply:** Competently apply a wide range of visualisation techniques and tools, also knowing their particular features and drawbacks.

Takeaways

    Visual representation of your dataset that enables you to answer the challenge you defined around it before and during the course.
    Skills to develop further visual literacy to support data-driven work.
